Nonograms are a puzzle similar to sudoku, and solving them results in a small picture.

# Basic rules

Each row and column has a list of numbers along it - each number represents a group of that length of **set** squares. When there are multiple numbers on one row/column, each group cannot touch each other! Click and drag in the following grid and see if you can solve it with only the row's numbers:

<NonogramExample
    gridString={`
        XXOXXX
        `}
    hideColumnKey={true}
    />


And by combining the information from rows and columns we can place cells that we couldn't place if we only knew either the row or the column:


<NonogramExample gridString={`
    XO
    OO
    `}/>

## Single row

To be able to build up what we know about each row, we need to be able to represent when we are unsure about a cell's value. From now on we'll use a checkered pattern fill to indicate if we're unsure if a cell is white or black, and only set a cell to a solid color when we're sure that it must be that color.

Now we can work on partially solving rows! By imagining the overlap of all the possible arrangements of the numbers in the row, we can mark down spots that are always the same in each arrangement. Try solving this row as far as you can, while leaving the unknown cells checkered:

<NonogramExample
    gridString={`
        XXOXXXO
        `}
    targetGrid={`
        -X--XX-
        `}
    hideColumnKey={true}
    />


Nice! This is a great way to start solving a nonogram when there isn't a completely full row. If you like, try a few different iterations to get a hang of how this type of deduction works.

<!---TODO: Add randomly generated new grids --->

Next up, we're going to have to know how to take partial info and solve a row or column further. We can use the same method we used to solve an empty row: imagine all of the possible arrangements of cells, and only mark the ones that don't change. This can allow us to place cells that we know are **unset**. Try that on this row, which starts with a new known cell:

<NonogramExample
    gridString={`
        XXOXXXO
        `}
    targetGrid={`
        XXO-XX-
        `}
    initialGrid={`
        X------
    `}
    hideColumnKey={true}
    />

Congrats, you've mastered the hardest part of solving nonograms! By repeating this process on rows, then columns, then rows again, you can get pretty far in most nonograms. Try a few randomly generated ones here:


<RandomExample
    height={7}
    width={7}
    />
