excerpt: Overview of Seeb Defender

Play a tower defense game with unique plants you have bred to the task. Seeb defender features fully simulated plant genetics and growth, where the player chooses how to crossbreed plants and bring out increasingly useful genes.

Using ingenuity and a discerning eye, learn what tower combinations are the most powerful, and what type of plant is best suited to support each type of weapon. Breed a plant with thorns to become long and snaking to ensnare the enemies. Or carefully select the siblings of a peashooter plant for longer range and more leaves to collect sunlight.

Find a plant with a high chlorophyll content, and interbreed it with other plants to improve their damage output. Slowly grow your bank of genes you have bred, and eventually unlock the ability to directly modify your plants genes!
